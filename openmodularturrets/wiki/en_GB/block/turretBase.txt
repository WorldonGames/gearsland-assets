The turret base is the foundation for every turret, it is available in 5 variations: Tier 1 - Tier 5.

Each base can can support it's own and previous tiers' turrets, but not tiers above it's own.

Each turret can be placed in any orientation from the base; top, bottom, left, right, front or back.

Turret bases use RF as a power source, and can be used with any item-piping system for automation.

The -Y configurable parameter is used to define how far below the turret it should look for targets.

Remember to shift-place turrets when placing then on a base
