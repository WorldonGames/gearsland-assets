[prefix{l}]Compact Machines[prefix{}]
The mod adds one simple game mechanic: Small rooms inside of blocks. It basically gives you the ability to build your contraptions inside of a single block.

Each side of a Compact Machine has a small buffer for items, fluids, gases and Redstone Flux allowing the room to interact with the outside. Applied Energistics channels and ProjectRed bundled cables are supported as well. The room has the corresponding counterparts on its walls.

[prefix{l}]Your first room[prefix{}]
* Craft yourself a [link{compactmachines/block.machine}]Compact Machine[link{}]
* Right click it with a [link{compactmachines/item.psd}]Personal Shrinking Device[link{}]
* Use the [link{compactmachines/block.interface}]Compact Machine Interfaces[link{}] in the walls to access the outside world
* Right click again to leave the block.

[prefix{l}]Nesting rooms[prefix{}]
It is possible to nest several rooms inside of each other. Be aware though: if they are not upgraded some of their content will probably get lost as soon as the most outer room, which contains all of the other rooms, is broken.
You can even nest the same room within itself by using a [link{compactmachines/item.quantumentangler}]Quantum Entangler[link{}].


[prefix{l}]Automatic chunk loading[prefix{}]
How automatic chunk loading behaves depends on config settings, so you have to ask the server owner or look into your config file to see which of the following modes applies to your instance.

[prefix{n}]Always [prefix{}]
The insides of Compact Machines will always be chunkloaded. You do not have to and should not place any chunk loaders inside your rooms.

[prefix{n}]Smart [prefix{}]
The rooms will be chunkloaded as long as their Compact Machine in the "real" dimension is being chunkloaded. If you want your room to always be chunkloaded, simply place a chunkloader in the overworld next to it. This works in a nested fashion, i.e. Compact Machines inside your rooms will automatically chunkload more rooms - because they are chunkloaded themselves.

[prefix{n}]Never [prefix{}]
The mod will never automatically load any chunks.
