[image{200, 20, 0.5, igwmod:textures/compactmachines/block_interface.png}]   [prefix{l}]Compact Machine Interface[prefix{}]



These blocks are not craftable, but each room has one for each side.

[prefix{l}]Buffers and connectivity[prefix{}]
With this block you have access to some buffers shared with the outside world. You have access to 1 stack of items, 1 bucket of fluid, 1024 units of gas, and 10000 RF.

The block additionally acts as a cable for Applied Energistics 2, as a bundled cable for Project Red or as a OpenComputers cable. This allows you to share the same ME and OpenComputers network with the outside world.

[prefix{l}]Hopping mode[prefix{}]
Each side of the room can automatically transfer the contents of its buffers to either the inside of the room or to the outside of the room. You can choose between four modes:

[prefix{n}]Disabled [prefix{}]
You have to actively pull out of the buffers

[prefix{n}]Importing [prefix{}]
The Interface will push into the inside of the room

[prefix{n}]Exporting [prefix{}]
The Compact Machine will push items into adjacent tiles on the outside

[prefix{n}]Auto [prefix{}]
This mode automatically pushes to the inside if the buffer has been filled from the outside and vice versa.

A side can only import and export at the same time if it's in Auto mode.
